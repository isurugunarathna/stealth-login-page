Protect your /wp-admin and wp-login.php pages from being accessed without editing .htaccess files. Optional wp-config.php variables for multi-site installs.

== Description ==

Protect your /wp-admin and wp-login.php pages from being accessed by obscuring the WP login form URL without editing any .htaccess files.

= What it does =

Without locking down access via IP address or file permissions, this plugin creates a secret, customizable, login URL string. Those attempting to gain access to your login form will be automatcally redirected to a customizable URL.

This is the first plugin that blocks external bot login requests - login requests must come from your customized URL or the request is rejected.

= Why it exists =

When using a login limiting plugin, it is possible that someone is on your network and attempting to login, which will then lock you out because you share the same IP address. This plugin hides your login screen so you don't experience lockdowns when you didn't create the lockdown. 

= NOTE =

This does NOT replace the need for security "best practices" such as a strong password or a secure hosting environment. This is an additional layer of security, best combined with a login limiter such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/limit-login-attempts/">Limit Login Attempts</a> or <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/login-lockdown/">Login Lockdown</a>.

== Installation ==

1. Upload contents of the directory to /wp-content/plugins/ (or use the automatic installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure the settings to create the secret URL string and redirect URL.
1. Verify it works by going to your default login form URL.

Add the following variables to wp-config.php if you are on a MU site and want to globally activate it with the same settings on all sites (change what is in quotes to your liking - no spaces allowed):

$slp_redirect = "URL";
$slp_question = "question";
$slp_answer = "answer";

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work on MU sites? =

Version 3.0.0 and greater is fully network-activated, includes uninstall, and bypasses all the settings pages with wp-config.php variables. See the Intallation tab or above in this file for instructions.

= I noticed Limit Login Attempts or Login Lockdown still reporting lockouts. Why? =

We've realized that bots (or really bored people) can enter a URL string in the address bar that attempts to log in without ever showing the login form. If the guess is unsuccessful, then they are redirected just the same and their IP address is logged by the other plugins. This reinforces the need for a 3-prong approach: strong credentials, login limiter plugin, and a stealthy login page.

= Are both the redirected folder /wp-admin and the page wp-login.php secured? =

Yes, as long as you are not actively logged into the site on that computer. You may enter your dashboard normally if you're in an active session. Once the session expires, you're further protected by it automatically redirecting rather than gaining access to the login form since WordPress redirects session timeouts to wp-login.php, unaware of the new URL string.

= What do I do if I forget my link and can't find the e-mail the plugin sent me? =

You'll need FTP access to your site. Renaming the stealth-login-page folder in /wp-content/plugins/ will remove the stealth security and allow you back into your dashboard.

Alternatively, you can use wp-config.php variables to bypass the settings page and regain control to access your dashboard again and change the settings page - then delete the wp-config.php variables.
